# julia_hdml
Julia code for high dimensional machine learning models. In this repository, you'll find some bioinformatic tools to analyze biological and genetics data with a focus on machine learning and statistics in high dimensions. You could also find some data engineering pipelines to handle big data. Here is an incomplete and quick list of topics:
+ **AWS**: read data from AWS S3 repository using *DuckDB*, *Arrow*, *Polars* and other tools
+ **SQL**: querying data from S3 and write simple SQL code to extract data
+ **Machine Learning**: mainly based on `MLJ` package &rightarrow; which allow us to write ML pipeline
+ **Statistics**: investigate hypothesis test and new correlation coefficients
+ **Linear Algebra**: to handle big data in genetics
+ **Bash**: bash script to automatically download data from URLs
